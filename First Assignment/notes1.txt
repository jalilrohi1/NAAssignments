about the code:
- code can probably use some refactoring
- some options are commented because with the enormous dataset it is supposed to use those functions are never going to finish,
    for in example the diameter or even basic plotting of the graph
- due to the "extreme" values of the graph, plots about certain metrics like the degree distribution are going to be weird
    or at least not very "pleasantly looking"
- some plots are still missing and will be added as soon as the main part of the remaining assignments will be done
- final conclusion about the graph being scale-free or not is left to discussion, it is not random due to the degree distribution
    but the wannabe-hubs are that "big" as one could imagine in a graph as big as this one, probably because of the physical limitations
    of the infrastracture network (there can be only so many roads/airports/ports)
- some extra comments can be added if needed
