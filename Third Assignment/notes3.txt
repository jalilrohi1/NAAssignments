tmp_dummy3.py: temporary file with very simple network of 5 nodes, used for initial testing of functions
tmp3.py: temporary file for the testing of the functions from tmp_dummy3.py on generated/real datasets as the exercise requires
assignment3.py: where the real assignment will be done once the functions have been properly tested

about the code:
- removing nodes can isolate some nodes, working on the giant component when calculating the metrics at each step is fundamental
    because networkx algorithms like diameter don't work on unconnected graphs
- important metrics like diameter, size of giant component and others will be calculated at each step
- probably going to introduce a loop with better structured functions for both removal of nodes and printing of metrics
- also need to add plots to better display the evolution of the graph
