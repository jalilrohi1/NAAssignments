about the code:
- some refactoring could be done
- function parameters choice could be improved, there might be inconsistency in the choises made
- some extra comments will be added to explain all the steps in the SRI model
- works on all datasets excluding the inf-italy-osm.edges
- extra plots will be added as soon as the core assignment3.py is finished
